// gnp/ring.hpp - the completion ring, and the producers that fill it.

// The ring is the single point where "how packets arrive" is decoupled from
// "who notices they arrived". Today the producer is a host thread
// (sim_inject.cpp); later it will be the NIC writing over PCIe. The consumer
// is always a CUDA kernel reading from an SM.
